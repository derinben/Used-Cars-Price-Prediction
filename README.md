Used cars are sold through a variety of outlets, including franchise, independent car dealers and rental car companies.Have you ever wondered how their prices are evaluated for sale?

You cannot take a wild guess at this because the Indian used car market was valued at USD 24.24 billion in 2019.
We have developed a regression model aiming to predict the prices of used cars in India using the attributes from the dataset.
